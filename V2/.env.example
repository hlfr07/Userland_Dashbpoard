# This is an example .env file
# The application doesn't require any environment variables for the frontend
# All configuration is done at login time through the UI

# Server URL is configured in the login screen
# Default: http://localhost:3001

# For the backend server (in the server/ folder), you can optionally set:
# PORT=3001
